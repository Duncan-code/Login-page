Team captain Puren Anyetu took advantage of an opportunity in the 28th minute to score an additional goal for the University. Before the close of the first half, Zetech’s Faith Muchora added a third goal before a challenged Mombasa Olympic FC managed a goal in the 42nd minute of the game, resulting in a 3-1 score in the first half, in favour of Zetech. The Second half action kicked off with a 45th minute goal from Zetech’s Elizabeth Khisa, giving the Zetech Sparks a steady run throughout the game to secure a win in the Cup.</p>
